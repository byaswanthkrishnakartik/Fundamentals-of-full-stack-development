HTML
------------------------------
 —HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language, which is responsible for
developing websites .
—Markup language
— computer language that uses tags to define
elements within a document.
—HTML responsible for structure of web pages .
—Elements are basics of HTML. Elements are represented as, we will
be having opening tag, followed by content and then clsoing tag .
<element>content</element>
ex:
for heading tag <hl> Heading </hl>
for pargarapgh tag
paragraph </p>
—Some tag consists of only one tag, they don't need seperate
closing tag.
for example, the image and line break elements .
ex: <img src=
<br/>
—you can observe these patterns: —
1. if we have to place the content then we need both opening
and closing tags. ex: heading tag
2. if we just have to set tag attributes in this case src is
tag attribute then we just need closing tag. ex: image tag
3. if we don't need content and tag attributes then also
closing tag is not required. ex: break tag
